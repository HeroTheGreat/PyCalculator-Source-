# Unity Python Calculator

Hey pals! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my kinda weird Unity Python Calculator project. So, um, I used Unity â€“ you know, that game-making thing â€“ and threw in some Python. It's like making a sandwich with whatever's in the fridge. Let me show you my creation!

## ðŸ¤· What's Going On?

### C# and Python Tag Team

Guess what? I made a calculator using Unity, and then I thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have Python in there too?" So, yeah, that's what happened. Unity's doing its C# thing, and Python's just chilling in the mix. It's like having two DJs at the same party!

### UnityPy: The Script Hero

- Meet [UnityPy](https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy), my secret weapon. It's like a magic spell that lets Unity and Python talk to each other.

- With UnityPy, I can run Python scripts right inside Unity. It's kinda like Unity's learning Python as a second language.

## ðŸ§° DIY Setup (because pros are overrated)

1. **Get the Project Thingie**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-python-calculator.git
    ```

2. **Open Unity, Like, Totally**
    - Launch Unity Hub and drag in the project folder. Easy peasy.

3. **Python Setup â€“ No Snakes Involved**
    - Make sure Python's on your computer. If it's not, well, Google's your friend.
    - Go to `Assets/Scripts/PythonIntegration` and type this cool thing:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## ðŸš€ Features â€“ Because Why Not?

- **Unity GUI + Python Brain:** The buttons and stuff are Unity, but the math is all Python. It's like Unity's using Python as its math tutor.

- **Python is not the coolest tho:** Python isn't just for snakes; it's for doing really smart math things. You'll see.

##  The code

- Unity C# scripts live in `Assets/Scripts`. They're the cool kids.
- Python scripts? Oh, they're hanging out in `Assets/Scripts/PythonIntegration`. They're like Unity's quirky friends.
